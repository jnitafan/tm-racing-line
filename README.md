# Racing Lines

## WARNING: PROOF OF CONCEPT, WILL LAG & CRASH YOUR GAME

Draws racing lines for players to follow. Essentially a merging of ghosts-pp & PlayerTrails where a "racing line" is generated by spectating a ghost and drawing a line showing where the player was.

Was done to learn openplanet.

This will never leave school mode since it gives an unfair advantage.
